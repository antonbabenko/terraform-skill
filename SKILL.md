# Terraform Skill for Claude

Comprehensive Terraform and OpenTofu guidance covering testing, modules, CI/CD, and production patterns. Based on terraform-best-practices.com and enterprise experience.

## When to Use This Skill

**Activate this skill when:**
- Creating new Terraform or OpenTofu configurations or modules
- Setting up testing infrastructure for IaC code
- Deciding between testing approaches (validate, plan, frameworks)
- Structuring multi-environment deployments
- Implementing CI/CD for infrastructure-as-code
- Reviewing or refactoring existing Terraform/OpenTofu projects
- Choosing between module patterns or state management approaches

**Don't use this skill for:**
- Basic Terraform/OpenTofu syntax questions (Claude knows this)
- Provider-specific API reference (link to docs instead)
- Cloud platform questions unrelated to Terraform/OpenTofu

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Structure Philosophy

**Module Hierarchy:**
```
environments/        # Environment-specific configurations
├── prod/
├── staging/
└── dev/

modules/            # Reusable modules
├── networking/
├── compute/
└── data/

examples/           # Module usage examples (also serve as tests)
├── complete/
└── minimal/
```

**Key principle from terraform-best-practices.com:**
- Separate **environments** (prod, staging) from **modules** (reusable components)
- Use **examples/** as both documentation and integration test fixtures
- Keep modules small and focused (single responsibility)

### 2. Naming Conventions

**Resources:**
```hcl
# Good: Descriptive, contextual
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" { }
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "application_logs" { }

# Good: "this" for singleton resources (only one of that type)
resource "aws_vpc" "this" { }
resource "aws_security_group" "this" { }

# Avoid: Generic names for non-singletons
resource "aws_instance" "main" { }
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" { }
```

**Singleton Resources:**

Use `"this"` when your module creates only one resource of that type:

✅ DO:
```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "this" {}           # Module creates one VPC
resource "aws_security_group" "this" {}  # Module creates one SG
```

❌ DON'T use "this" for multiple resources:
```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "this" {}  # If creating multiple subnets
```

Use descriptive names when creating multiple resources of the same type.

**Variables:**
```hcl
# Prefix with context when needed
var.vpc_cidr_block          # Not just "cidr"
var.database_instance_class # Not just "instance_class"
```

**Files:**
- `main.tf` - Primary resources
- `variables.tf` - Input variables
- `outputs.tf` - Output values
- `versions.tf` - Provider versions
- `data.tf` - Data sources (optional)

## Testing Strategy Framework

### Decision Matrix: Which Testing Approach?

| Your Situation | Recommended Approach | Tools | Cost |
|----------------|---------------------|-------|------|
| **Quick syntax check** | Static analysis | `terraform validate`, `fmt` | Free |
| **Pre-commit validation** | Static + lint | `validate`, `tflint`, `trivy`, `checkov` | Free |
| **Terraform 1.6+, simple logic** | Native test framework | Built-in `terraform test` | Free-Low |
| **Pre-1.6, or Go expertise** | Integration testing | Terratest | Low-Med |
| **Security/compliance focus** | Policy as code | OPA, Sentinel | Free |
| **Cost-sensitive workflow** | Mock providers (1.7+) | Native tests + mocking | Free |
| **Multi-cloud, complex** | Full integration | Terratest + real infra | Med-High |

### Testing Pyramid for Infrastructure

```
        /\
       /  \          End-to-End Tests (Expensive)
      /____\         - Full environment deployment
     /      \        - Production-like setup
    /________\
   /          \      Integration Tests (Moderate)
  /____________\     - Module testing in isolation
 /              \    - Real resources in test account
/________________\   Static Analysis (Cheap)
                     - validate, fmt, lint
                     - Security scanning
```

### Native Test Best Practices (1.6+)

**Before generating test code:**

1. **Validate schemas with Terraform MCP:**
   ```
   Search provider docs → Get resource schema → Identify block types
   ```

2. **Choose correct command mode:**
   - `command = plan` - Fast, for input validation
   - `command = apply` - Required for computed values and set-type blocks

3. **Handle set-type blocks correctly:**
   - Cannot index with `[0]`
   - Use `for` expressions to iterate
   - Or use `command = apply` to materialize

**Common patterns:**
- S3 encryption rules: **set** (use for expressions)
- Lifecycle transitions: **set** (use for expressions)
- IAM policy statements: **set** (use for expressions)

## Module Development

### Standard Module Structure

```
my-module/
├── README.md           # Usage documentation
├── main.tf             # Primary resources
├── variables.tf        # Input variables with descriptions
├── outputs.tf          # Output values
├── versions.tf         # Provider version constraints
├── examples/
│   ├── minimal/        # Minimal working example
│   └── complete/       # Full-featured example
└── tests/              # Test files
    └── module_test.tftest.hcl  # Or .go
```

### Best Practices Summary

**Variables:**
- ✅ Always include `description`
- ✅ Use explicit `type` constraints
- ✅ Provide sensible `default` values where appropriate
- ✅ Add `validation` blocks for complex constraints
- ✅ Use `sensitive = true` for secrets

**Outputs:**
- ✅ Always include `description`
- ✅ Mark sensitive outputs with `sensitive = true`
- ✅ Consider returning objects for related values
- ✅ Document what consumers should do with each output

**For detailed module patterns, see:**
- **[Module Patterns Guide](references/module-patterns.md)** - Variable best practices, output design, ✅ DO vs ❌ DON'T patterns
- **[Quick Reference](references/quick-reference.md#common-patterns)** - Resource naming, variable naming, file organization

## CI/CD Integration

### Recommended Workflow Stages

1. **Validate** - Format check + syntax validation + linting
2. **Test** - Run automated tests (native or Terratest)
3. **Plan** - Generate and review execution plan
4. **Apply** - Execute changes (with approvals for production)

### Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Use mocking for PR validation** (free)
2. **Run integration tests only on main branch** (controlled cost)
3. **Implement auto-cleanup** (prevent orphaned resources)
4. **Tag all test resources** (track spending)

**For complete CI/CD templates, see:**
- **[CI/CD Workflows Guide](references/ci-cd-workflows.md)** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Atlantis integration, cost optimization
- **[Quick Reference](references/quick-reference.md#troubleshooting-guide)** - Common CI/CD issues and solutions

## Security & Compliance

### Essential Security Checks

```bash
# Static security scanning
trivy config .
checkov -d .
```

### Common Issues to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Store secrets in variables
- Use default VPC
- Skip encryption
- Open security groups to 0.0.0.0/0

✅ **Do:**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager / Parameter Store
- Create dedicated VPCs
- Enable encryption at rest
- Use least-privilege security groups

**For detailed security guidance, see:**
- **[Security & Compliance Guide](references/security-compliance.md)** - Trivy/Checkov integration, secrets management, state file security, compliance testing

## Version-Specific Guidance

### Terraform 1.0-1.5
- Use Terratest for testing
- No native testing framework available
- Focus on static analysis and plan validation

### Terraform 1.6+ / OpenTofu 1.6+
- **New:** Native `terraform test` / `tofu test` command
- Consider migrating from external frameworks for simple tests
- Keep Terratest only for complex integration tests

### Terraform 1.7+ / OpenTofu 1.7+
- **New:** Mock providers for unit testing
- Reduce cost by mocking external dependencies
- Use real integration tests for final validation

### Terraform vs OpenTofu
